// PROMPT 3: LOGIN & AUTHENTICATION PAGE

// OBJECTIVE
// Design a modern, futuristic, and secure login page for the "Lunar Vault" web app. The page must serve as a seamless entry point into the application, introducing the user to the core aesthetic while providing a clear, focused, and frictionless authentication experience.

// DESIGN & LAYOUT
// 1. AESTHETIC: FUTURISTIC & IMMERSIVE
// - The login page must be consistent with the app's "Living Interface" theme, feeling clean, modern, and sophisticated.
// - It should immediately establish the app's futuristic tone without overwhelming the user.

// 2. BACKGROUND: DYNAMIC & COHESIVE
// - The page must feature the same dynamic, animated celestial background used throughout the main application. This creates a cohesive and immersive experience from the very first interaction.

// 3. FORM CONTAINER: FLOATING GLASSMORPHISM
// - The login form should be presented on a central, floating **glassmorphism panel**.
// - This panel must be translucent with a frosted glass effect, allowing the animated background to be subtly visible, which adds a sense of depth.
// - The layout should be focused, using the glassmorphism panel to draw the user's attention directly to the login action with minimal distractions.

// 4. TYPOGRAPHY & COLOR
// - Typography must adhere to the established brand guidelines (Headings: Montserrat, Body: Roboto).
// - The color palette should be consistent with the selected theme (Dark or Light Mode), ensuring high contrast and excellent readability for all text and UI elements.

// FUNCTIONALITY & ELEMENTS
// 1. INPUT FIELDS
// - Provide clean, clearly labeled fields for "Email" and "Password."
// - When a user interacts with a field, it should have a subtle highlight or border animation to provide clear visual feedback.

// 2. SOCIAL LOGINS
// - Prominently display social login options (e.g., "Sign in with Google," "Sign in with Apple") to offer a frictionless, one-click sign-in process.
// - These buttons should be visually distinct from the primary login button but stylistically consistent with the overall design.

// 3. PRIMARY ACTION BUTTON
// - The "Login" button should be the most prominent interactive element on the panel.
// - It should feature a subtle animation on hover (e.g., a soft glow or a slight change in depth) to signal interactivity and align with the "Living Interface" theme.

// 4. SECONDARY ACTIONS
// - Include clear, accessible text links for essential secondary actions, such as "Forgot Password?" and "Sign Up."
// - These links should be less prominent than the primary action button to maintain a clear visual hierarchy.
